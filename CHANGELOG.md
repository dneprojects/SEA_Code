# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Guided setup wizard ("Einrichtung"): instead of unreliable auto-classification,
  the user assigns the entities the agent really needs per logical category
  (v1: PV, heat pump, grid), choosing from HA-ranked suggestions — independent of
  which HA device an entity belongs to (solves scattered heat-pump entities and
  power measured by a separate Shelly PM3). New `setup_catalog.py` (slot catalog)
  and `suggest.py` (ranking + energy-prefs prefill); endpoints under `/api/setup/*`.
- Pre-fill from the HA Energy dashboard (`energy/get_prefs`): solar/grid power
  (`stat_rate`), energy meters, price entity and named device consumption
  (heat pump) are proposed top-of-list; one-click "Aus Energy-Dashboard übernehmen".
- The live energy balance now uses this explicit configuration once PV or grid
  power is set (`aggregator.balance_from_config`), falling back to the legacy
  role-based aggregation otherwise.
- Device view reworked: entities grouped by logical category (PV / heat pump /
  grid) with live values, regardless of their HA device (`GET /api/categories`).
- Tests for the suggestion ranking, energy-prefs prefill and config-based balance.

- Phase 2 (forecast): history-based household consumption forecast
  (recency-weighted hour-of-day load profile, weekday/weekend split) with a
  backtest of forecast accuracy (MAE/MAPE).
- Phase 2 (forecast): PV forecast from Home Assistant. Primary source is the
  Energy-dashboard `energy/solar_forecast` (Forecast.Solar; HA-cached, no
  upstream API hit, no entity config needed); a configurable PV-forecast entity
  (Solcast `detailedForecast`, generic list) is the fallback. The solar forecast
  is pulled on connect and refreshed every 15 min. Plus the resulting PV-surplus
  forecast (surplus = PV − load) — all via `GET /api/forecast`.
- New "Prognose" dashboard view: 24 h consumption/PV/surplus chart, kWh summary
  and forecast-error figure.
- Add unit-test setup (`pytest`, `requirements-dev.txt`) covering the forecast.

## 0.1.0

- First version: detection and curation of energy-related entities, live energy
  flow, history, consumer configuration, tariffs (purchase price/feed-in
  compensation), savings calculation with selectable baseline, and
  (off-by-default) PV-surplus control.

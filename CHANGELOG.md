# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Wizard fixes: multi-select (PV) no longer accumulates silently — already
  selected entities that the current search hides are now pinned (and can be
  unchecked), and the list re-renders after each change. The invert flag
  (grid / battery) is now also visible in the device view, which shows the
  sign-adjusted live power.
- Wizard: added the **wallbox / EV charger** category (charging power + energy +
  control actuators: charge-current setpoint and on/off), prefilled from the
  Energy dashboard's named device consumption.
- Heat pump now supports **multiple entities per quantity**: several power and
  energy meters (e.g. two pumps, summed), plus multi temperature sensors
  (heating circuits, DHW/buffer tanks — shown in the device view) and multiple
  control actuators (climate entities / setpoints per circuit). Energy-dashboard
  prefill accumulates several matching device-consumption entries into a list.

- Guided setup wizard ("Einrichtung"): instead of unreliable auto-classification,
  the user assigns the entities the agent really needs per logical category
  (v1: PV, heat pump, grid), choosing from HA-ranked suggestions — independent of
  which HA device an entity belongs to (solves scattered heat-pump entities and
  power measured by a separate Shelly PM3). New `setup_catalog.py` (slot catalog)
  and `suggest.py` (ranking + energy-prefs prefill); endpoints under `/api/setup/*`.
- Pre-fill from the HA Energy dashboard (`energy/get_prefs`): solar/grid power
  (`stat_rate`), energy meters, price entity and named device consumption
  (heat pump) are proposed top-of-list; one-click "Aus Energy-Dashboard übernehmen".
- The live energy balance now uses this explicit configuration once PV or grid
  power is set (`aggregator.balance_from_config`), falling back to the legacy
  role-based aggregation otherwise.
- Wizard now also covers the **battery** (charge/discharge power + SoC, sign
  flag; included in the balance: house = pv + grid − battery) and **control
  actuators** — for the heat pump a climate/thermostat entity or a number
  setpoint for the temperature setback/raise (marked "Stellgröße").
- Device view reworked: entities grouped by logical category (PV / battery /
  heat pump / grid) with live values, regardless of their HA device
  (`GET /api/categories`).
- App version shown in the header.
- Tests for the suggestion ranking, energy-prefs prefill (incl. battery) and
  config-based balance (incl. battery).

- Phase 2 (forecast): history-based household consumption forecast
  (recency-weighted hour-of-day load profile, weekday/weekend split) with a
  backtest of forecast accuracy (MAE/MAPE).
- Phase 2 (forecast): PV forecast from Home Assistant. Primary source is the
  Energy-dashboard `energy/solar_forecast` (Forecast.Solar; HA-cached, no
  upstream API hit, no entity config needed); a configurable PV-forecast entity
  (Solcast `detailedForecast`, generic list) is the fallback. The solar forecast
  is pulled on connect and refreshed every 15 min. Plus the resulting PV-surplus
  forecast (surplus = PV − load) — all via `GET /api/forecast`.
- New "Prognose" dashboard view: 24 h consumption/PV/surplus chart, kWh summary
  and forecast-error figure.
- Add unit-test setup (`pytest`, `requirements-dev.txt`) covering the forecast.

## 0.1.0

- First version: detection and curation of energy-related entities, live energy
  flow, history, consumer configuration, tariffs (purchase price/feed-in
  compensation), savings calculation with selectable baseline, and
  (off-by-default) PV-surplus control.
